# RecipeExplorer

### Steps to Run the App
Just compile and run on device or simulator. My app runs on iOS 17 or later.

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
I mainly prioritized the UI, as that is my main passion when it comes to iOS development.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
I spent a little more than 5 hours working on this project. The reason I took a bit longer was because I had to learn how to cache images and the XCTest framework on the fly, as they are something I haven't done or haven't used in a while, respectively. I mainly allocated time to getting tests and the caching working.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
I would've added a favorite recipe feature, the ability to filter recipes based on cuisines and a search feature, but due to time constraints I didn't do so. As well, I would've made the UI look a little prettier but due to the same reason as above I didn't do so.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
I think I could've made more comprehensive tests, but due to time I didn't. 

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
I found this project fun! It was nice to have free rein over the process and what features to add. Even if I don't make it to the next round of interviews, I still learned a lot from this process.
